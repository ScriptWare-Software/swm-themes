## ↓ Downloading themes

Currently you can download themes from the `submissions` folder on this repository. In future we will have a website to browse and preview themes.

## ↑ Submitting themes

Currently, submitting a theme is a manual process. In future we plan to automate this, but for now, do the following.

**We ask that you only upload themes that you have created.**

1. Sign up for a GitHub account
2. Rename your SWM theme to the following format: `USERNAME_THEMENAME.swmtheme`
    - Theme names must be alphanumeric (A-Za-Z0-9), that means, no spaces, no special characters.
    - For example, if I (theLMGN) created a theme called Red Sea, the file name would be `theLMGN_RedSea.swmtheme`
4. Click the `Fork` button in the top right on this page.
5. When your forked repository is created, go to the `submissions` folder and select the `+` icon near the top right.
6. Select `Upload files`
7. Upload your swmthemes and then select `Commit changes`
8. Go here: https://github.com/jellyfish-lsef/swm-themes/compare and select `Compare against forks`
9. Where it says `head repository` on the right, select the drop down and select the one with your name
10. Select `Create pull request` and submit your pull request!
11. If all goes well, your pull request will be merged and your theme will be published!
     - If we need to contact you with any problems, we will comment on the pull request. In most cases this will send you an email, but please check your pull request every once in a while. If this is not possible, put your your Discord name and tag (Name#0000) in the pull request description.
